## Introduction

In 2021, I read a book called **Atomic Habits**, by James Clear. It influenced me in my decision to start reading more. So I did. I kept my reviews for the various books I have read in a Google document. I figured why not use my coding skills to build an application from it. I was curious what it would look like in a different format. This is the product of a habit I have built from it.
